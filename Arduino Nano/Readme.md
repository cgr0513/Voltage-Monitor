This file is for the Microcontroller board used in the Voltage monitor.

The diagram below shows that the initial plan is to design a printed circuit board (PCB) for flexible microcontroller usage when changing microcontrollers.
When an accident occurs, the microcontroller can be easily removed and replaced with the same or a different type.
All pins on the boards will be mounted with headers, making it easy to replace microcontrollers. Even if the new microcontroller is a different type, the wire connection will be easier to change.

However, even if the connection was stable until now,
the strength of the connection might be a concern since all wires are connected without any notches. Future improvement might need to take place
