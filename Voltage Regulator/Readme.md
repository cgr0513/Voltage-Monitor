This is a voltage regulator Circuit documentation.

The voltage regulator PCB includes four different voltage outputs.
The maximum current capacity can vary depending on the linear voltage regulator.

The current problem is the regulator's heating. The power losses are happening at the regulator but are negligible since the current flowing through is insignificant.
However, this could be improved in the future
